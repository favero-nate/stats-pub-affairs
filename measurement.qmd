# Measurement {#sec-measurement}

Two main statistics traditions in social science\
• Psychometrics: applied statistical methods\
developed for studying psychology\
• Central focus on measurement error\
• Many methods for data with multiple measures of\
constructs (e.g., survey data with multiple items for\
each construct)\
• Commonly used in psychology and related research\
areas (organizational behavior, public opinion)\
• Key methods include reliability measures, factor\
analysis, SEM\
• Econometrics: applied statistical methods developed\
for studying economics\
• Central focus on threats to accurate causal inference\
• Commonly used in many social science disciplines\
• Key method is regression

Reliability measures\
• Basic intuition: if we measure a construct multiple\
times or multiple ways, the various measurements\
should give us similar results (unless there’s reason\
to believe the true value of the construct has changed\
between measures)\
• If the measurements are inconsistent (unreliable),\
this undermines confidence in the measures\
• Most reliability measures indicate some sort of\
correlation (or average correlation) among measures,\
so the maximum value (perfect reliability) is typically 1

• There are often cutpoints offered as “rules of thumb”\
for what constitute “good” or “acceptable” levels of\
reliability; I think these are of somewhat limited use\
since different types of measures allow for different\
realistic levels of reliability\
• Even if reliability is high, there is no guarantee that\
validity is high—no guarantee that the variables\
actually measure what we want them to measure\
• Cronbach’s alpha: the most common measure of\
reliability when researchers have multiple survey\
items that are supposed to measure a single\
construct\
• Essentially measures the average correlation among\
a set of variables

Scaling\
• Scaling: combining multiple measures of a construct\
into a single variable\
• Example: combining responses to several survey\
items to form a single variable\
• Simplest scaling method: taking the average (or\
sum) of several measures\
• If measures don’t have a common scale, we might\
want to first standardize the items before\
averaging/totaling them\
• Assuming there is a common scale, all measures are\
given equal weight in contributing to final measure

• Factor analysis: an approach to scaling that allows\
for estimation of different weights to assign to\
different measures\
• Basic intuition: assign weights to different measures\
to maximize the extent to which a single common\
(latent) factor can explain the variation in the various\
measure

• If you’re only interested in using items to measure a\
single variable, factor analysis is fairly\
straightforward: it will assign less weight to items that\
have a relatively weak correlation with the other items\
whereas taking a simple average will give all items\
equal weight\
• Factor loadings will give an indication of which\
variables having stronger weights (values closer to 0\
have less weight)\
• A negative factor loading indicates a negative weight,\
meaning that higher values of that item correspond to\
lower values of the factor index

Factor analysis\
• There are many types of factor analysis\
• One of the simplest is principal components analysis,\
often abbreviated PCA or PCF (for principal\
components factor analysis)\
• PCA is a type of exploratory factor analysis, meaning\
that you don’t necessary have to specify how many\
constructs you wish to measure with the variables\
you have or which measures you expect to measure\
which constructs\
• PCA can essentially find groupings of measures that\
have high correlations with one another and identify a\
factor (new scaled variable) for each grouping\
• PCA assumes that each factor is uncorrelated with all\
other factors, but other types of factor analysis allow\
for correlated factors

• Basic PCA will make it so that the first factor explains\
as much variation in the measures as possible, the\
second factor explains as much of the remaining\
variation as possible (after creating the first factor),\
etc.\
• “Rotation” allows for the variation to be split up more\
evening among factors, but you must specify how\
many factors you want to create\
• There’s no obvious way to choose how many factors\
to retain, but several approaches (beyond the scope\
of this course) are frequently used

• Each measure will have a factor loading for each\
factor; this loading indicates the correlation (ranging\
from -1 to 1) between that measure and the factor\
• Each factor will have an eigenvalue, indicating how\
much of the variation in the measures is explained by\
that factor\
• With PCA, the eigenvalue divided by the number of\
measures indicates the proportion of variance in the\
measures that can be accounted for with that factor

SEM\
• SEM allows for scaling (think factor analysis) and\
estimation of associations (think regression) to be\
simultaneously carried out in a single model\
• By combining these two steps, SEM is able to easily\
account for certain types of measurement error\
• More traditional econometric approaches typically\
assume there is no error in the independent/control\
variables, although econometric regression\
approaches have been developed that allow for\
measurement error (they’re just not widely used)\
• SEM users often include multiple mediating and/or\
dependent variables, unlike most regression models\
• One can think of these multiple links as similar to\
running multiple regressions successively, like we’ll\
learn how to do next week with mediating variables

• SEM can be a useful way to model measurement\
error, but there are some potential pitfalls\
• SEM models typically assume that measurement\
error is uncorrelated across items; violation of this\
assumption is often referred to as common method\
variance or common source bias and is very difficult\
to deal with, even with SEM\
• SEM typically has arrows that indicate causal\
directions, but the models are not able to do much to\
distinguish which direction causality flows (does A\
cause B, or does B cause A?); instead the causal\
direction is assumed\
• Tests of whether the model adequately fits/explains\
the data exist, but these tests are not very informative\
in practice
