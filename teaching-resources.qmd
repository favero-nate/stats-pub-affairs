# Teaching Resources {#sec-teaching-resources .unnumbered}

If you're using this text, I'd love to know. You can fill out this brief form (<https://forms.gle/qBUFdb4vEuDUkzBu6>), where you can also sign up to receive emails when I post updated versions or related materials.

## Stata/R Labs

I've created a number of Stata and R labs that I use when I teach. There are also some handouts, including a couple covering Excel. Such resources are available here: <https://github.com/favero-nate/minus-the-math/tree/main/labs>

## Lecture Slides/Videos

While they do not directly correspond to this version of the text, there are some (Stata-based) lecture slides and videos I created to use alongside this book when I teach. They are currently available here: <https://github.com/favero-nate/minus-the-math/tree/main/lecture_slides>

## A Few More Details about What's Unique in this Text

1.  There is a bit of Stata code in one appendix (@sec-qual-associations), but otherwise all examples are presented apart from any statistical software package.

2.  The treatment of probability theory skips much of the typical material in favor of discussing probabilistic modeling, which I believe is far more relevant to quantitative social science.

3.  In addition to traditional statistical inference ideas that describe estimating parameters of population from a sample, I emphasize that we often use inference to draw conclusions about counterfactuals. This approach is informed by Kass (2011): <https://doi.org/10.1214%2F10-STS337>
