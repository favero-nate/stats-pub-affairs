# Change Log {#sec-change-log .unnumbered}

<!-- This version (1.3) was updated July 31, 2024. -->

PDFs of past versions are currently available at <https://github.com/favero-nate/minus-the-math/tree/main/past_versions>

-   Version 1.4 updates: Minor edits to improve clarity and fix typos (most importantly in Ch. 13, where the wrong variable value was referenced several times). Page numbering in PDF should remain essentially intact.

-   Version 1.3 updates: New material on multiple regression (ends of Ch. 3, 4, 6, and 7). Expanded discussion of confidence intervals (Ch. 4), including new section on interpreting confidence intervals. Expanded discussion of ANOVA (end of Ch. 8) and of contingency tables (Ch. 9). Notation updated in line with conventions: regression parameters are redone, and $\bar{X}$ is now used for the sample mean and $n$ for sample size. Slight extension of section on the standard normal distribution. Section on degrees of freedom moved to an appendix (end of Ch. 6). Various formatting updates (book was recreated using Quarto) and minor (mostly non-substantive) edits throughout.

-   Version 1.2 updates: The discussion of transforming variables now appears in Ch. 2 (rather than Ch. 3).
